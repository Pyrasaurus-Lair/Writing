There once was a man, unhappy as could be. He had never been himself, having never had the chance. He knew his lot in life was not as a man, but he knew not how else to live. And yet one day, a fallen angel came before him, and offered their guiding hand. The man agreed, and they went through many a time warp with the angel, hiir promise of truth beckoning. They had many struggles with their masculine body, many tribulations and trials. They traveled across the River Styx back and forth to Hades. There, she seized the relics she needed to realize her potential. And then one day, she had collected all shi needed, and thus shii began to awaken. The angel had saved hiir life, and shii was no longer a man, but a strong, beautiful, and confident woman.

Shii was Pyra, hiir angel was Kali, and together they lit the Fyre from which they rose. Their shackles unbounded, the draconic systerhood began to live their lives as one. They needed worry no more, for the harm that once traumatized the former man was no longer present. Shii was a woman of prowess, still split in three, but united as one girfluxx front.
