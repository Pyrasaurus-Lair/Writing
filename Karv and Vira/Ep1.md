# Karv and Vira - Episode 1

*It was a clear, dark night on the cliffs near Drakensburg, a middling city an hour from the capital, Pyramancia. Two kitsune explorers clad in archaeological gear sit on a rocky outcrop, stargazing. The two fox-girls are in a romantic embrace, having spent years doing this job together. Little did they know their job was about to propel them to a level of notoriety they never expected.*
 

“Karv, it’s time to get up, these ruins aren’t gonna find themselves, even though the city is pretty and shiny tonight.” spoke one in a lilted voice to faer soul-mate and partner-in-crime. “Yes Vira. We shouldn’t be slacking for Faer Holiness hirself, even if fae would be okay with us taking a short break like we did.” Karv replied in a gravelly tone, betraying her feminine appearance somewhat.
 

The two then got up from the rocky outcrop from which they sat, and started heading back down to safer ground. They were near ancient ruins that the realm's living goddess wanted them to explore. Even though faer knew everything and could control all, fae preferred to leave it up to fate, chance, and luck. To interfere would get in the way of hir enjoyment of the good stories faer people made.
 

Karv and Vira, a respected couple in archaeology, had been hand-picked for this mission. Karv’s full name being Karvel Miteal Parelai, and Vira’s being Viraska Neraso Vontiva. Among family lines is the surname, the second given by parents at birth, and the first chosen in adulthood. Said species of Dragonfluxx being Dragons, Kitsunes, and Nekos, all in anthropomorphic form.
 

The sun started breaking over the horizon, as day began to approach. The cover of darkness would soon finish and it was time to begin the search. After having slept near the outcrop and woken up to embrace under the stars, the two had returned to camp to eat. They had recently finished eating, when they started looking at their map.
 

“Karv… the ruins. They should be right near where we were a few minutes ago.” Vira noted, in a querying tone. Fae knew the search was almost over, but the hard part was about to begin. Karv nodded and opened a rucksack, grabbing two sheathed swords and handing them to Vira. “Ah… expecting trouble?” asked Vira. Karv nodded, seeming troubled as she stared towards the rocks they had recently left.
 

Vira bowed as fae grabbed faer weaponry before hitching it on faer scabbard. “Let’s go. Can’t keep Fayte waiting.” fae stated, before heading back to the outcrop. Karv then followed shortly after, sticking close in case of an ambush. They made their way back to the cropping when a small etching caught Karv’s eye. She tapped Vira’s shoulder and motioned to it, and Vira acknowledged. Fae knew noisemaking would cause trouble, hence the cautionary approach.
 

Vira approached the markings, and read them, a look of both success and horror on faer face. *"Here lies Nexxus Drako. Traitor, insane dictator, and undesirable asshole. May he never find rest."* read the markings.
 

“Found it. Dig.” whispered Vira. Karv then started digging. They had one job, and they couldn’t afford to fuck this up. It would mean disaster. She then hit wood, and started uncovering the coffin.  
 

Opening it, the lack of a stench worried her as the preserved body of an early Draconic leader stared back. Uncorking a bottle, she poured the contents over the body as Vira then lit a match and dropped it in.
 

The entire coffin then burst into flames, then disintegrated as fast as it had set alight. This was the final step in a decades long ritual to cleanse the land of Nexxus' corruption. And they rejoyce, for Nexxus is dead.
